All content related to the project will be examined, sample presentation will be watched:
•	Project-2 file has been examined
•	The project purpose file was reviewed
•	Project presentation control form was examined
•	Project roadmap presentation was examined
•	Sample project followed

Purpose of the Project:
•	Development and implementation of dashboards by performing data analysis to make informed strategic decisions,
•	Optimizing business operations,
•	Develop to monitor and analyze key metrics to increase profitability.

Revenue Metrics Objectives:
•	Cash Flow Analysis: It will enable them to monitor and analyze the financial data of the project, including Income-Expense-Profit.
•	Determination of Profit and Growth Factors: Analyzing revenue data, determining the key factors affecting profitability and determining the measures to be taken to increase revenue.
•	Supporting Strategic Decisions: Project managers will be able to use dashboards to develop strategies and tactics to increase revenues and optimize business processes.

Project Technical Acceptance Criteria:
•	Dashboard bulunması gereken metrikler: MRR, Paid Users, ARPPU, New Paid Users, New MRR, Churned Users, Churn Rate, Churned Revenue, Revenue Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, Customer Lifetime, LTV (3.Modül 2.Konu ayrıntılı bilgi var) – En az 10 metrik olmalı,
•	There should be 3 Filtering: Date – Language – Age
•	Will Contain At Least 5 Charts: Two of them must be graphs showing the month-to-month change factors of income and paid users. An example of this is available in the link (It doesn't have to be the same image)
•	It will comply with the criteria to be considered when preparing a dashboard (5sec, color palette compatibility, etc.)

Considerations:
•	There are 2 basic files (games_paid_users and games_payments) Apart from that, there is advertising expenditure data in the games.csv file, it can be used during analysis,
•	Conversion Rate (CR) can be used as an additional metric – such as CR to Paid,7
•	Can EMU/WAU/MAU metrics be used, examine from the data set,
•	Can the forecast model be improved for the next time period?
•	The relevance of the data with cohort analysis or pairplot should be examined,
•	Data Cleaning and Data Accuracy Check: Is there any empty, repetitive data (The same id can be of different age, the same id can be a different language, etc.)
•	User age and payment dates can be checked (Data accuracy quality is checked)
•	What can be done within the scope of Feature Engineering – it can be used in modeling: DAU/WAU/MAU, age groups, active time use, etc.
