SUMMARY STATEMENT:

Conducted comprehensive data quality assessment across two datasets using SQL, Python, and Excel; identified missing values, incorrect data types, and data inconsistencies.

Performed statistical analysis and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for metric calculation, merging sources to ensure reliable results.

Calculated key revenue metrics including MRR, Paid Users, ARPPU, New MRR, Churned Revenue, Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).

Designed advanced visualizations using Tableau, supported by Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python, for multi-angle revenue performance monitoring.

Uncovered critical insights across three games and three language groups (Ukrainian, Russian, English):
• Game 1 and Game 2 showed low revenue and user counts; further analysis revealed these products were newly launched (3 and 6 months old, respectively) with incomplete data for November. Recommended against premature discontinuation.
• Game 3 demonstrated high revenue potential; first 6-month performance used as a benchmark for other products.

Identified core revenue concentration within the 16–25 age group, supported by statistical evidence (mean age: 23, std: 6.6), leading to targeted marketing recommendations.

Detected concerning trends:
• Contraction MRR increased significantly in recent months, surpassing Expansion MRR.
• Net active users declined to -5 in the final month of analysis, correlating with seasonal effects (Christmas/New Year holidays) but signaling retention challenges.

Proposed data-driven action plan:
• Run A/B tests to reduce churn and re-engage inactive users.
• Launch cross-promotions targeting Game 3 players for other products.
• Enhance English language support to expand the underperforming English-speaking user base.
• Conduct periodic revenue trend monitoring to preempt further contraction.
