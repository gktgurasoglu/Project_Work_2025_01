Technical task
The data for this task is stored in the "project" schema in the PostgreSQL Database that we use to perform the assignments in the SQL block.
Create a dashboard to analyze cash flows in the project. Through the dashboard you create, product managers will monitor the dynamics of changes 
  in cash inflows and perform a high-level analysis of the factors behind these changes.

A dashboard should include all or at least most of the following metrics:
•    Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the amount of revenue for a calendar month; however, this revenue is only from sources that recur from month to month.
•    Paying Users – the number of users who make payments.
•    Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU) – the average revenue per paying user. ARPPU is calculated as Revenue / Paid Users.
•    New Paid Users – the number of users who started paying during the relevant time period.
•    New MRR is the MRR generated by paid users during the relevant month.
•    Churned Users – the number of users who stopped paying during the relevant time period.
•    Churn Rate is the ratio of Churned Users in the target time period to Paid Users in the previous period. For example, Churn Rate (June) = Churned Users (June) / Paid users (May)
•    Churned revenue – the total revenue from all users who stopped paying in the previous period.
•    Revenue Churn Rate is the ratio of revenue generated by users who stopped paying in a given calendar month to the revenue generated in the previous month. 
     For example, Revenue Churn Rate (June) = Churned Revenue (June) / MRR (May)
•    Expansion MRR is the amount by which MRR increases from one month to the next. It is calculated based on users who start paying more in the current month.
•    Contraction MRR is the amount by which MRR decreases from one month to the next. It is calculated based on users who start paying less in the current month.
•    Customer Lifetime (LT) is the average time from the first payment to user churn. In other words, it is the total time an average user spends with the product.
•    Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is the average total amount paid by a user during the entire time they use the product. In other words, it is the total amount paid to the company by an average user.

On the dashboard:
•    The dashboard should consist of at least five graphs.
•    The dashboard should include filters based on date, user language, and user age.
•    Among the charts included in the graph, there should be at least two charts showing the monthly change factors for revenue and paid users.

Delivery format:
The completed task should consist of two parts:
1. Save the query you wrote in SQL as a .sql file.
2. Create a Dashboard in Tableau.

Technical criteria for task acceptance:
•    A dashboard has been created in Tableau Public.
•    The dashboard is available online to all users.
•    The dashboard contains data obtained by querying tables in the “project” schema of the database to which the mentor has granted you access.
•    The dashboard includes at least ten of the following metrics: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Paid Users, Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU), 
     New Paid Users, New MRR, Churned Users, Churn Rate, Churned Revenue, Revenue Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, Customer Lifetime (LT), Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)).
•    The dashboard includes filters based on date, user language, and user age.
•    The dashboard includes at least five graphs.
•    The dashboard includes two graphs showing the monthly change factors for revenue and paid users.
•    The visual design of the dashboard complies with:
      o    5-second principle;
      o	   Location of important information;  
      o    Display of metrics and signatures;  
      o    Use of a color scheme.
