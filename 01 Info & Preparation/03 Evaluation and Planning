A cash flow analysis dashboard will be created to monitor and analyze the project's financial data, including revenues, expenses, and profits.
The key factors affecting the project's profitability will be identified, and measures that can be taken to increase revenue will be determined.

•    The requirements and demands of the task were reviewed, and two files containing the data set were opened and previewed. In this context:
      The requested KPIs will be added to the dashboard,
      The specifically requested graphic design will be added,
      Three filters/slicers will be added,
      The task is to be performed using SQL and TABLEAU,
      As a result of the file preview, it is understood that we do not have many options in terms of feature engineering.

•    Our two data files will be analyzed using PostgreSQL:
      Column names and data types will be examined—data type conversion will be performed if necessary.
      The total number of rows and the presence of NULL values will be checked.
      If NULL values are present, a decision will be made based on the situation—deletion/average/median, etc.
      Basic statistical calculations will be performed on columns containing numerical values to gain general information,
      The time range covered by the data will be determined,
      The meaningfulness and completeness of the data will be evaluated,
      The rows and columns that need to be added to the main query before proceeding to the visualization stage will be added.

•    Once the main query has been created, TABLEAU will be used for visualization:
      KPI calculations will be performed on this platform,
      Care will be taken to ensure that the dashboard is arranged in a manner that is consistent with its visual aesthetics and financial analysis presentation.

•    The analysis and visualized report will be presented using Power Point software.
